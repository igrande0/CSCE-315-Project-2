The Java GUI was compiled and run using Eclipse IDE. Importing the code into an eclipse project and running it will guarantees that the program successfully executes. We were unable to test the program in the unix enviornment as attempts to run the Jar file resulted in a JVM error that was due to the version of Java running on the Unix server. Note that the GUI will only connect to sun.cse.tamu.edu on port 50000 and will only create the GUI if it can actually connect to a gameplay server!
